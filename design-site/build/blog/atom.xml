        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Server side build failure is a fairly common and frustrating issue that is encountered when generating documentation sites with tools like Docusaurus. SSR issues typically arise when code that functioned flawlessly in a client-side React app is incorporated on a doc site either as a component or live code block.
