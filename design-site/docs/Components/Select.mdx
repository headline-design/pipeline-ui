# Select

Use the Select component when you want your users to select an option from a list. Select provides a styled version of the HTML select. This component is specifically useful for long lists you wouldn't want to display using Radio buttons like currencies or states.

import {Select, AsaList} from 'pipeline-ui'

<Select options={AsaList}/>

## Usage Example

```jsx
import {Select, AsaList} from 'pipeline-ui'

<Select options={AsaList}/>
```
