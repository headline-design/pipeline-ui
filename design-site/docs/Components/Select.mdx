# Select

Use the Select component when you want your users to select an option from a list. Select provides a styled version of the HTML select. This component is specifically useful for long lists you wouldn't want to display using Radio buttons like currencies or states.

import {Select, AsaList} from 'pipeline-ui'


## Usage Example

```jsx
import {Select, AsaList} from 'pipeline-ui'
```

```jsx live
<Select options={AsaList}/>
```

The value of the options prop is an array of objects:

```jsx
const options = [
  { value: '1', label: 'Algorand' },
  { value: '2', label: 'Ethereum' },
  { value: '3', label: 'Bitcoin' }
]
```
