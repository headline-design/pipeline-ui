Welcome to Pipeline UI, a library of standardized React components for the Algorand Ecosystem!

:::info

WalletConnect is now supported in all Pipeline libraries!

:::

### Install the library:

```bash
cd myNewApp
npm install pipeline-ui
```
### Import components into your React project:

```jsx
import { AlgoButton, AlgoSendButton, Pipeline} from 'pipeline-ui';
```

:::caution

All Pipeline UI libraries and demos execute transactions on the Algorand MainNet by default. To send transactions on the TestNet, check out [SwitchNet Component](./AlgoComponents/SwitchNet)

:::

### Modifying the library:

If you wish to download and modify the library components via source code, run the following code to save it to your user root directory and install its dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/headline-design/pipeline-ui
cd pipeline-ui
npm install
```

You may then edit the components via the index.js file found inside each component folder in the parent folder /src. After saving changes, you must then run the following code from the pipeline-ui parent folder:
```bash
npm run build
npm pack
```

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

<img alt="Docusaurus with Keytar" width="100%" height="400px" src={useBaseUrl('/img/pipeline_vectilla_10.svg')} />
