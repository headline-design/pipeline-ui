# Overview

The Smart Contract Command Lab is an online tool to experiment with deploying and using TEAL (Transaction Execution Approval Lanuage) smart contracts.

Check out the [VIDEO](../Videos) to see it in action!

:::

## Get started

- • Select your net (for security reasons, the demo only allows the selection of testnet. You can enable mainnet by forking our github repository and adding MainNet to the network `<Select>` element)

- • Navigate to your MyAlgo wallet and set your wallet to testnet using their dropdown menu.

- • Fund your wallet via the link provided in the Demo

- • Select either a Reach or TEAL contract using demo's the dropdown menus. 

:::tip

The demo's `log` window will only log messages provided by the Reach "frontend" code or transaction id's for TEAL-only deploys. We recommend that at this point the user open their browser console log by right-clicking on the screen, hitting `inspect` and selecting the `console` option.

- • For all Reach contracts (except `Morra Game`), clicking `Deploy and Run Reach` will both deploy the smart contract and run the frontend and "backend" code associated with the Reach example, using your own connected addess to run the code for all participants.

- • A key feature of our implementation of the `Morra Game` is to demonstrate how Reach code can be utilized without any RPC servers or backends needed. Identical code exists on all client machines and runs entirely client-side (with the exception of the smart contract), with participants merely inputing the app id of the Morra Game smart contract. 

- • The Morra Game must be played with two seperate addresses (documented below)

- • For the provided TEAL contracts, clicking `Deploy TEAL Contract` will merely deploy the smart contract with hard-coded global/local bytes/integers and the following initial appArgs: 

```jsx
let registrationStart = algosdk.encodeUint64(params.firstRound)
let registrationEnd = algosdk.encodeUint64(params.firstRound + 1000)
let voteStart = algosdk.encodeUint64(params.firstRound + 2000)
let voteEnd = algosdk.encodeUint64(params.firstRound + 3000)
```

- • Custom TEAL contracts will also be only deployed, but `appArgs`, byte slices and local/global integers can be fully customized. Appargs are entered as an array of strings `["",""]` and formated behind the scenes by the Demo's code. 

## Morra Game

Selecting the `Reach Morra Game` will display a dropdown to select a role and an input for an app id.

- • To run the game, 2 users load the demo on seperate machines and connect their seperate accounts. The user who will deploy the contract and act as participant `Alice` selects the `Deployer & Participant` role and clicks `Deploy & Run Reach`.

- • Immediately after deploying the contract, `Alice` must locate the app id on AlgoExplorer and share it with user `Bob`.

- • User `Bob` inputs the app id, selects the `Participant` role and clicks `Deploy & Run Reach`.

- • At this point, the Reach code automatically generates the bets and guesses for both participants, only requiring that the transactions be signed in the MyAlgo popup windows.

- • If the smart contract obverves a winner, the winner will receive the amount wagered by the loser.

- • In the event of either a winner or timeout, the Reach code will automatically prompt user `Alice` to delete the app.

## Adapting Reach Code

The code examples provided in the ReachLang github examples folder can be utilized in serverless online apps via the following process: 

- • Clone the repo and compile the Reach code following the instructions provided on the Reach doc site

- • Copy the "backend" code from the created `build` folder and import it into your main JavaScript or React file (app.js or index.js)

- • Copy the "frontend" code (index.mjs from parent folder) and paste or import it into your main file. 

- • replace the following line wherever it occurs with a variable that contains an Algorand address as string:

```jsx
await stdlib.newTestAccount(startingBalance);
```

- • Locate the code that begins at: 

```jsx
await Promise.all([
```

- • Copy this entire block and rewrite it to conditionaly run only the segment corresponding to the role that the client selects. 

- • Replace the `getInfo()` function call with `parseInt(appId)` and set `appId` to the id of the smart contract

- • Replace `ldstdlib` call with:

```jsx
const stdlib = loadStdlib('ALGO')`
```

Finally, the following code must be run before the Reach frontend code:

```jsx
stdlib.setWalletFallback(stdlib.walletFallback({
    providerEnv: net, MyAlgoConnect
}));

stdlib.getDefaultAccount().then(
    response => {
        acct = response.networkAccount.addr;
    }
)
```
